- count up every day (probably want to use some other way than waiting, due to server restarts )
- when day hits, count online players into an array
- delete text document (read on, you will understand)
- run a foreach on all the players, adding them to a text document (in future this can be a database, though i think a doc is the best idea) and teleporting them
- when a player joins, see if they're on the text document yet. if not, teleport them randomly and then add them, also, to the database/text doc.
